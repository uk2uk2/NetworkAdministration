Fundamental Networking Concepts for Network Admin Repository
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
Overview
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the core routing protocol of the internet, used to exchange routing and reachability information between autonomous systems (AS). An autonomous system is a collection of IP networks under a single administrative domain, like an ISP or a large organization. BGP is defined in RFC 4271 and is essential for inter-domain routing, ensuring data packets find the best path across the global internet.
Unlike interior gateway protocols (IGPs) like OSPF or EIGRP, which optimize for speed and bandwidth within a network, BGP focuses on policy-based routing. It allows network administrators to control traffic flow based on attributes like path length, origin, and community strings. BGP operates over TCP port 179 and uses a finite state machine for session management.
Key features:

Path Vector Protocol: BGP advertises paths to networks, including the sequence of AS numbers traversed, to prevent routing loops.
Scalability: Handles millions of routes; uses route aggregation and prefix lists to manage table size.
Policy Control: Attributes like AS_PATH, LOCAL_PREF, MED (Multi-Exit Discriminator), and communities allow fine-tuned routing decisions.
eBGP vs iBGP: External BGP (eBGP) for peering between different AS; Internal BGP (iBGP) for within the same AS, requiring full mesh or route reflectors to avoid loops.

BGP might be used if you have multiple ISP connections for redundancy (multi-homing). For example, to advertise your public IP prefixes to ISPs and handle failover.
How BGP Works

Peering Establishment:

Neighbors are manually configured (no auto-discovery).
Open messages exchanged to negotiate parameters.
Keepalives (every 60s by default) maintain sessions.


Route Advertisement:

UPDATE messages send routes with attributes.
Best path selection: Highest LOCAL_PREF, shortest AS_PATH, lowest origin type (IGP < EGP < Incomplete), lowest MED, etc.


Route Withdrawal:

If a route becomes unavailable, it's withdrawn via UPDATE.


Convergence:

BGP can be slow to converge due to timers (e.g., 180s hold time), but BFD (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) can speed it up.



Common BGP Commands (Cisco-like Routers)

Configure BGP: router bgp <AS_number>; neighbor <IP> remote-as <remote_AS>.
Advertise Network: network <prefix> mask <subnet_mask>.
Show BGP Summary: show ip bgp summary (check neighbor status: Idle, Active, Established).
Show BGP Routes: show ip bgp or show ip bgp neighbors <IP> routes.
Clear BGP Session: clear ip bgp <neighbor_IP> (soft reconfiguration with neighbor <IP> soft-reconfiguration inbound).

Troubleshooting BGP

Session Not Establishing: Check TCP 179 connectivity (telnet <neighbor> 179), AS mismatch, ACLs/firewalls.
Routes Not Advertised: Verify network statements, filters (prefix-lists, route-maps).
Flapping Routes: Monitor logs for hold time expirations; adjust timers or use damping (bgp dampening).
Blackholing: Use communities like 666 (common blackhole) to discard traffic.
Common Issues in Financial Networks: Ensure BGP security with MD5 authentication (neighbor <IP> password <secret>) and prefix filtering to prevent route leaks.

Anticipate: misconfigured BGP could lead to internet outages, affecting networked services - Use route reflectors for scalability if multiple routers.
Security Best Practices for BGP

TTL Security: Set neighbor <IP> ttl-security hops 1 to prevent spoofing.
Prefix Filtering: Use ip prefix-list to allow only expected prefixes.
RPKI (Resource Public Key Infrastructure): Validate route origins to prevent hijacking (e.g., via ARIN or RIPE).
BGPsec: Emerging standard for path validation (not widely deployed yet).

Scripts for BGP Monitoring
Bash Script: Basic BGP Neighbor Check (Assumes Linux with Bird or FRR)
#!/bin/bash
# bgp_neighbor_check.sh: Checks BGP neighbor status
# Usage: ./bgp_neighbor_check.sh

if command -v birdc >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  birdc show protocols | grep bgp | awk '{print $1, $6}'  # Name and State (Established/Idle/etc.)
elif command -v vtysh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  vtysh -c 'show ip bgp summary' | grep -E 'Neighbor|Up/Down'
else
  echo "BIRD or FRR not detected. Install for BGP monitoring."
fi

Python Script: Parse BGP Routes (Requires netmiko if SSH to router; assumes viable)
from netmiko import ConnectHandler
import re

def check_bgp_routes(device_ip, username, password):
    device = {
        'device_type': 'cisco_ios',
        'host': device_ip,
        'username': username,
        'password': password,
    }
    try:
        net_connect = ConnectHandler(**device)
        output = net_connect.send_command('show ip bgp summary')
        neighbors = re.findall(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+)\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+\d+\s+(\w+)', output)
        for neigh, state in neighbors:
            print(f"Neighbor {neigh}: {state}")
        net_connect.disconnect()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

# Usage: check_bgp_routes('192.168.1.1', 'admin', 'password')
